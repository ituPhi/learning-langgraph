## âŒ¨ **Cursor Rules**

We will be using Cursor Rules in this demonstration, Cursor Rules help define how AI agents interact with the 
code, automate tasks, and follow specific workflows. These rules guide how agents should generate, modify, or test code within the 
development environment.

Here is the Cursor Rules we are using in this demonstration

```js title="api-ui-test.mdc"
When I say /test, then perform following

Navigate to http://localhost:8000/Product/List. 

Create product by clicking Create link . 

Then create a product with some realistic data for Name, Price and Select ProductType as CPU and click create input type with id as Create. 

Check the Database for the created record

Use the Schema: http://localhost:8001/swagger/v1/swagger.json

Here is the baseURL of API Base URL: http://localhost:8001/

Also check the API which performs the GET operation if the values are correctly retreived for the created product from the above schema
