# ðŸŽ¥ Recording Actions

Playwright MCP allows you to record your browser interactions and automatically generate test specifications. This feature helps you create automated tests without writing code manually.

## Getting Started

To start recording your actions and generate test files, you'll need to:

1. Start a recording session
2. Perform your actions using MCP tools
3. End the session to generate the test file

### Example

Here's a complete example of recording actions and generating a test spec:

1. First, start a new recording session by specifying:
   - Where to save the generated tests (`tests/generated` directory)
   - What to name your tests (using 'LoginTest' as a prefix)
   - Whether to include helpful comments in the generated code

2. Then perform the test actions:
   - Navigate to the Sauce Demo website (https://www.saucedemo.com)
   - Enter "standard_user" in the username field
   - Enter "secret_sauce" in the password field
   - Click the login button

3. Finally, end the recording session to generate your test file

The generated test file will look something like this:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('LoginTest_2024-03-23', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to the login page
  await page.goto('https://www.saucedemo.com');

  // Fill in username
  await page.fill('#user-name', 'standard_user');

  // Fill in password
  await page.fill('#password', 'secret_sauce');

  // Click login button
  await page.click('#login-button');

  // Verify successful login
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*inventory.html/);
});
```

## Configuration Options

When starting a recording session, you can configure several options:

- **outputPath**: Directory where the generated test files will be saved
- **testNamePrefix**: Prefix for the generated test names
- **includeComments**: Whether to include descriptive comments in the generated tests

For example, you might configure your session to:
- Save tests in a 'tests/generated' folder
- Name tests with a 'MyTest' prefix
- Include helpful comments in the generated code

## Session Management

You can manage your recording sessions using these tools:

- **get_codegen_session**: Retrieve information about a recording session
- **clear_codegen_session**: Clean up a recording session without generating a test

These tools help you check the status of your recording or clean up if you want to start over without generating a test file.

## Best Practices

1. **Organize Tests**: Use meaningful test name prefixes to organize your generated tests
2. **Clean Up**: Always end or clear your sessions after recording
3. **Verify Actions**: Include verification steps in your recordings
4. **Maintain Context**: Keep related actions in the same recording session
5. **Documentation**: Add comments during recording for better test maintainability

## Running Generated Tests

To run your generated tests, use the Playwright test runner:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/generated/logintest_*.spec.ts
```

:::tip
You can modify the generated test files to add additional assertions, setup, or teardown code as needed.
